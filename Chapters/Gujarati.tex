\secstar{Introduction}

Gujarati script is an abugida like many other Indic scripts rather than
alphabet. It is used for languages like Gujarati and Kutchi. Gujarati script is
variant of Devanagari script differentiated by the loss of the characteristic
horizontal line running above the letters and by a small number of
modifications in the remaining characters.

The modern Gujarati alphabet has vowel letters, consonant letters, and a few
other symbols.
